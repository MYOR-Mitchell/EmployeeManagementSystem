# Employee Management System (EMS)

## Overview
The **Employee Management System (EMS)** is a **console-based application** built in **C#**, created to efficiently manage employee information. It has core functionalities for **adding, editing, deleting, and retrieving employees** 
while using validation checks and clean design principles.

Originally this started as a learning project, but it's now being **refined and updated** to follow **better design patterns** and soon integrate a **SQL database** for persistent storage.


## Features
- **Add New Employees** – Save employee details.  
- **Edit Employees** – Modify existing employees information.  
- **Remove Employees** – Delete a saved employee.  
- **Retrieve Employees** – Fetch and view employee details by **ID or name**.  
- **Sorting Functionality** – Organize employees by **hire date, name. and more**.  
- **Validation System** – Verify user inputs meet required formats.  
- **Interactive Menu System** – Console-based UI.  
- **Separation of Concerns** – Clear distinction between data handling, UI, and logic. 


## Tools Used  
- **C#** (Main programming language)  
- **.NET Core** (Framework)  
- **Object-Oriented Programming** (OOP)  
- **Dependency Injection**  
- **SOLID Principles**  
- **Console-Based UI**  

## Future Enhancements
- **Add SQL Database** – Replace in-memory storage with **SQL** database.  
- **Improve Unit Testing** – Add tests for validation, sorting, and CRUD operations.  
- **Add Logging** – Track actions and errors within the system.  
- **Enhance UI** – Convert to a web-based application using **Blazor WebAssembly** or **ASP.NET MVC**.  


## The Journey Continues!
This console app has followed back from when I first began coding.  
It got messy (some valuable learning accidents happened here), but now it's back—**cleaner, better, and ready to grow.**   
I'll continue refining and improving it, and with time, I'll mold it into something amazing!
